# Lemonade UI Redesign Prototype

A **React 19 + TypeScript + webpack** proof-of-concept for the next-generation Lemonade UI. This prototype is built side-by-side with the existing `src/app/` and `src/web-app/` in the main codebase and now runs **real-server-first** against `lemond` at `http://localhost:13305` by default. It is designed to work both as a web app and as a desktop Tauri application — a single React codebase powering both delivery channels.

**Not production code** — this is an active design and engineering POC on branch `feat/ui-testing`. See [`.squad/decisions.md`](../../.squad/decisions.md) for the design rationale and capability-keyed presets architecture (v1.4).

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** (check `package.json` `engines` field for exact requirement)
- **npm 10+**
- Optional for UI-only review, recommended for functional testing: a running `lemond` instance at `http://localhost:13305` or a custom URL entered in Connect

## Quick Start

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Opens at **http://localhost:8080** with hot-module reloading via webpack-dev-server.

## Build & Distribution

### Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

Outputs optimized bundles to `dist/`.

### Watch mode (for development)

```bash
npm run watch
```

Incrementally rebuilds on file changes.

## Testing

### Headless tests (CI mode)

```bash
npm test
```

Runs all UI-safe Playwright tests headless via Chromium. Real-server smoke tests are opt-in so they fail fast instead of silently passing without a running server or loaded model:

```bash
LEMONADE_REAL_SERVER=1 npm test
```

Artifacts are saved under Playwright's per-test output folders, so screenshots from repeated runs are not overwritten.

### Headed tests (visible browser)

```bash
npm run test:headed
```

Opens the browser so you can watch the tests run step-by-step.

### First run setup

On first run, Playwright may ask to install browser binaries:

```bash
npx playwright install
```

## What's Implemented

This prototype showcases the **redesigned UI** with capability-keyed presets (v1.4):

### UI Panels
- **Chat** — multi-turn conversation with streaming support, scoped user/guest history, omni-capable composer routing, preset selector, sampling controls
- **Models** — model registry with load/unload, custom model/custom omni registration, categorized view (Loaded / Downloaded / Registry / HuggingFace)
- **Backends** — device-first capability matrix, backend versions and status
- **Connect / Discover** — integration showcase and curated model feed
- **Presets** — capability-keyed preset system with chat/omni (Balanced, Quality, Fast, Creative, Long Context, Code) and image (Sharp, Quick) starters

### Multimodal / Omni Mode
- **Omni capability detection** recognizes loaded models marked as `omni`, `multimodal`, `vision`, VLM, LLaVA, Pixtral, Qwen-VL, MiniCPM-V, Mllama, GPT-4o-style, and similar names or labels.
- **Omni composer mode** keeps those models in chat instead of misrouting them as plain LLMs or image/audio utility models. Text, image attachments, and one audio attachment are sent through `/api/v1/chat/completions` using OpenAI-style multimodal content parts.
- **Specialized modes remain explicit:** image models route to `/api/v1/images/generations`, Whisper/Moonshine transcription models to `/api/v1/audio/transcriptions`, and TTS models to `/api/v1/audio/speech`.

### Custom Models
- **Custom model form** on the Models page lets a user register a local/HuggingFace checkpoint or path, recipe/backend, labels, and capability.
- **Custom Omni models** are first-class: choose `Omni` in the capability dropdown and the composer treats the model as multimodal chat even if the server health response later lacks perfect capability metadata.
- **Scoped per user:** custom definitions are saved under the active guest/user storage scope. Guest custom models are shared on the browser; signed-in users get private custom definitions.
- **Load path:** custom models register/pull with the current Lemonade payload (`model_name`, `checkpoint`, `recipe`, capability booleans, optional `mmproj`). Custom Omni collections register as `recipe: "collection.omni"` with a `components` array, then load by `model_name`.

### Local Users / Privacy Prototype
- **Guest mode is shared:** users can chat without signing in. If guest history is enabled, it is visible to anyone using the same browser profile.
- **Named local users:** users can create an account with name + password. Passwords are salted and hashed with PBKDF2 in browser storage; raw passwords are never stored.
- **Scoped data:** conversations, active chat, tools setting, user presets, and custom model definitions are namespaced under `lemonade:<storageScope>:...`. Signed-in users see only their own local profile data.
- **Deletion rules:** guests can delete shared guest data, signed-in users can delete their own scoped data/account, and the first local account is admin with an all-local-user-data reset. The account UI lives in `src/features/accounts/` so it can be extracted/replaced by server-backed auth for production.

### Presets v1.4 Features
- **Capability-keyed compatibility** — presets declare `applies_to: [capability]` and models declare `labels`; runtime matches by label intersection
- **Staged bindings** — when you adjust preset settings (temperature, top-p, etc.), they show "Will apply on next load" — no immediate server calls
- **Sampling wired** — temperature, top_p, top_k, repeat_penalty settings are forwarded to `/api/v1/chat/completions`
- **Advanced disclosure** — backend hint field behind an Advanced toggle for power users
- **Distinct image presets** — Steps and CFG scale controls for image generation, separate from chat sampling

## Connecting to a Server

The prototype stores an explicitly chosen Lemonade server URL in local browser state. For the packaged Lemonade web app, if that state is missing or has been cleared, the API client also tries the current browser origin, so a custom Lemonade host/port is recovered when the UI itself is served by `lemond`. During local webpack development it still prefers the usual `http://localhost:13305` server and retries the current origin if needed. Use the Connect screen to change the URL; the field validates `http://` / `https://` URLs before attempting a request and shows the exact endpoint plus HTTP/network error on failure. API keys can be kept session-only or explicitly persisted.

Core API paths are normalized to `/api/v1/...` in `src/api.ts`. Mocked responses are no longer the default runtime path; use Playwright route mocks in tests when a deterministic mocked scenario is needed.

## Troubleshooting

### Port 8080 is already in use

```bash
npm run dev -- --port 9000
```

Webpack dev server will bind to the next available port, or specify one explicitly with `--port`.

### Playwright browser not found

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

This downloads the Chromium binary used by Playwright tests.

### Hot reload isn't working

Check that webpack-dev-server is running (it should print the URL). If you edited a file and the page didn't update, try:
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Restart `npm run dev`

### "Connection refused" when pointing at a real lemond

Verify the server is running (`lemond` or `lemonade launch`), check the URL in the Connect screen, and ensure no firewall is blocking the port. Try `curl http://localhost:13305/api/v1/health` from the terminal, or replace the port with your configured server URL.

### Test timeouts or failures

Playwright waits up to 60 seconds by default (see `playwright.config.ts`). If tests time out:
- Check that `npm run dev` is running on port 8080
- Verify network connectivity (especially for real-server tests)
- Run `npm run test:headed` to see what the browser is actually doing

## Design & Architecture Notes

- **Single codebase, dual delivery:** The same React source powers both web-served and desktop (Tauri) builds. Platform-specific code uses feature detection, not separate branches.
- **Real-server-first development:** Runtime calls go to Lemonade-compatible `/api/v1/...` endpoints. Tests that need deterministic data should mock those network routes explicitly.
- **Local client state:** Conversation history is opt-in and now scoped to either the shared guest space or a signed-in local user. The account menu controls profile deletion; admin can clear every local profile.
- **Client-only auth caveat:** The account prototype protects data by browser-storage namespace and password-hash login, but production must enforce users, sessions, and authorization on the backend.
- **Custom model caveat:** Custom model records are prototype metadata; production should validate checkpoint paths, allowed recipes, and permissions server-side before loading.
- **Presets are client-side:** Presets are not persisted to the server; they're computed locally based on the model registry and user adjustments, and user-created presets are scoped per local user/guest space.

## Next Steps

To integrate this prototype into the main codebase:

1. Coordinate with Kyle and the team on the next milestone (web app only vs. Tauri desktop first)
2. Move approved UI components to `src/web-app/` or `src/app/` as appropriate
3. Keep API calls aligned with the finalized `/api/v1/...` server contract and add route-level mocks only for deterministic tests
4. Update the main `CMakeLists.txt` build targets and Web app webpack if needed

See [`.squad/decisions.md`](../../.squad/decisions.md) and [`.squad/agents/mattingly/history.md`](../../.squad/agents/mattingly/history.md) for the full decision trail and learnings.

### Follow-up fixes in this prototype package

- Omni registry/custom collection models stay selectable as the Omni wrapper even when lemond reports the loaded runtime as individual vLLM/llama/vision/audio components.
- Model typing is deliberately conservative: vLLM and plain LLM recipes stay in LLM mode; only explicit Omni/multimodal/VL metadata or collection recipes become Omni.
- Model downloads are started with server-owned persistence (`subscribe: false`) and the Models page polls `/api/v1/downloads`, so active downloads reappear after refresh/new tab on servers that expose the downloads API.
- Custom Omni collections can be created from named text, vision, image, transcription, and speech components and are sent to Lemonade as `collection.omni` plus `components`, not as pseudo-checkpoint registrations.
- Account popovers use an opaque raised surface so labels remain readable over the model grid.
- Backend summary now falls back from `/system-info` `lemonade_version` to `/health` `version`, so Linux builds no longer show `Lemonade unknown ...` when system-info omits the version.
